# KFPBot, made by BennyYasuo

This is the official KFPBot which is being used by KFP right now, although he has a modified version, which removes my trademark.
I will not allow him to claim it as his own, as he didn't work on it at all, so I will gladly open source this project. I will also
open source the spambot he asked me to write for him. 

# Lies and Deception

Although me and KFP parted both on bad ways, he has been telling everyone that I am the bad guy, but that is not the case. He was the
one not respecting me although making 75% of his channel. That includes multiple bots spamming his channels, multiple versions of KFPBot,
a website that I hosted for free, and a Minecraft server that I hosted all for free. And that was all me. He didn't do any of that.
He failed to be respectful and he got what he asked for. Stop believing his lies, please. He is a manipulative person who should not
be trusted.
